## A refresher

- **Class**: "a table", "a person" (acts as a blueprint/contract for something)
- **Properties**: "width", "height" (the elements of the blueprint)
- **An object**: "our kitchen table", "Raf" (an instance of a class)
- **Interface**: A contract/abstraction a class should conform to.
- **Abstract Class**: Default functionality for subclasses.

- [Composition vs abstraction](https://javapapers.com/oops/association-aggregation-composition-abstraction-generalization-realization-dependency/)

### Design Patterns

A description on how to solve a generic problem that can occur in different situations. Proven solutions.

---

### Design Patterns - Classification

- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral
- (Concurrency)

---

### Creational - Dependency Injection

- inject a class into another class
- depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations (inversion of control)
- [you use this in your code already](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

---

### Creational - [Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/csharp/example)

- one centrally managed instance
- a less icky global variable
- creates hard dependencies

---

### Creational - [Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)

- centralized creation of objects via a factory method

---

### Structural - [Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)

- converts from one class to another one

---

### Behavioral - [Iterator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator)

- make sure you can iterate over items without knowing how the iteration itself works
- your basic foreach loop

---

### Behavioral - [Chain of Responsibility](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility)

- pass an object through a chain of handlers
- the handler indicates if an event can be handled
- ... and how to handle it
