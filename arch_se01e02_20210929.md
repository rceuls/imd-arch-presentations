## Lesson 2 - API design

---

### API?

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API>
- An application exposing endpoints that can be used by other applications.

---

### REST

- Represential State Transfer
- Request/Response mechanism
- Pro: easy, high adoption rate
- Con: overfetching, underfetching, roundtrips

---

### REST - Principles

#### Stateless

- No state kept by the server
- When context is needed, the client should send it along
- Why: higher volume, no concurrency problems, ...

---

### REST - Principles

#### Cacheability

- When you can cache, you should cache.
- Should be indicated by the server.

---

### REST - Principles

#### Layered

- Connection should be transparant for the client.
- Allows scaling, proxies, ...

---

### REST - Principles

#### Uniform Interface

- An abstraction layer between server and client.
- Self-explanatory
- HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the engine of application state)

---

### REST - Greenfield design

- Almost always over http(s)
- Almost always using JSON
- No verbs, only nouns
- Logical nesting
- Use HTTP methods and return standard error codes
- Always keep the use cases in mind
- Security!

---

### REST - Versioning

- An API is a contract
- Changing the contract means implementing a new version
- Numerous libraries exist to facilitate this

---

### ASP.NET Core

- Support out of the box for API
- `dotnet new webapi --help` lists all the options.
- Defaults are fine, maybe check out `-n`
- Live demo!

---

## Your own API!

### Things to look at

- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) with [Swashbuckle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-swashbuckle?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio) (by default installed).
- [HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
- [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
- [Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)
- [The example repo]()

---

### Things to do

- Read the annual exercise
- Take a piece of scratch paper
  - Write down your entities and actions on those entities
  - Sketch out your endpoints
- Make your API return mocked (i.e. fake) data
- Make sure the code ends up in GitHub and runs on everyone's computer
