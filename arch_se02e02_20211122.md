## API design

---

### Oh no, not again

![bg left 70%](./images/se02e02/gF4SJw82_400x400.jpeg)

- Yes, again
- More about the structure of your API and why
- Best practices, not laws.

---

### The definition

> A REST API is an application programming interface that conforms to specific architectural constraints, like stateless communication and cacheable data. It is not a protocol or standard. While REST APIs can be accessed through a number of communication protocols, most commonly, they are called over HTTPS.

Paraphrased from <https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/>

### Always JSON

![bg left 100%](./images/se02e02/json.jpg)

- Defacto standard
- Human readable
- Lots and lots of libraries in lots and lots of languages.
- `Content/Type`: use it, respect it

---

### Nouns

- Nouns, your HTTP method implies what you are doing
- Almost all actions can be reduced to CRUD (create/read/update/delete)

| Method | Endpoint           | Body   | Does                                     | Idempotent? |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| GET    | /videos            | (none) | Reads all the videos                     | Y           |
| GET    | /videos/{id}       | (none) | Reads the data of one video              | Y           |
| GET    | /videos/{id}/roles | (none) | Reads all data of the roles of one video | Y           |
| POST   | /videos            | json   | Creates a new video                      | N           |
| PUT    | /videos/{id}       | json   | Creates or updates data                  | Y           |
| DELETE | /videos/{id}       | (none) | Deletes a single video                   | Y           |

### Nesting resources

- Some resources only make sense in the context of another resource (we only want to see a certain role in relation to a movie)
- Nest them; a `404` for the parent is also a `404` for the child.

---

### Explicitly handle errors

- Nobody likes a big stacktrace (you might, your end user won't)
- Make your errors make sense
- Use a good status code (NOT_FOUND is not UNAUTHORIZED is not SERVER ERROR)
- Make sure you make a distinction between 4XX ("you fucked up") and 5XX ("we fucked up") errors. Most clients should handle them differently.
- Put a nice error in the body.
- Leverage infrastructure

---

### Sorting, Pagination, ...

- Build for growth
- Make sure a client can narrow down their requests to only get what they need.
- Avoid heavy loads on your database / external resources

---

### Caching

- If your data doesn't change => cache
- Avoid a database hit when you don't need to hit it
- Cost saving, more performant

---

### Versioning

- When you break stuff, add a new version
- Give your clients time to upgrade

---

### Security

- Best practices: SSL, authentication, infrastructure, ...
- According to Kapersky, a security breach costs in average $500.000. Additional costs can be up to $80k.
- Most of the time your users/colleagues are the problem, but implementing low-key easy solutions is both cheap and an extra insurance

---

### HATEOAS

> Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is a constraint of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from other network application architectures.

> With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia. A REST client needs little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS>

### Libraries

### Security HOWTO

- Difficult, lots of considerations
- Ask someone else
- Probably already handled by your seniors unless you startup your own startup.

---

### Architectural considerations

- Remember: your application is a social construct. End-end-end user is a human.
- Your endpoint should do one thing and do it well (single-responsibility)
- Remember interface-segregation; generic APIs are it's own kind of hell.
- KISS: simplicity is also a key design goal.
